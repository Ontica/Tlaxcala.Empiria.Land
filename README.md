# Empiria Land Tlaxcala edition

[Empiria Land](http://www.ontica.org/land/) is a suite of powerful solutions that provide information services
for land recording offices, cadastral departments and other land management governmental organizations.

This repository corresponds to the custom-tailored version of that system for the
use of the Government of the State of Tlaxcala, Mexico.

The project is based on C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.2, with ASP .NET.

As other Empiria products, this frontend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

Additionaly, this product also needs the full set of [Empiria Land](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Land) backend components.

The project can be compiled using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
